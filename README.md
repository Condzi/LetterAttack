# Letter Attack
Game that improves your typing skill. Inspirated by some old game named 'Letters of Death' or something like that.

## Purpose
I want to test concept Inheritance + std::variant. I use inheritance to have some basic methods like `onUpdate`, `kill` and variant to avoid using dynamic allocation and polymorphism.
## Tech
SFML 2.4.2, C++17. Compiled on MSVC using VS2017.
